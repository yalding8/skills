# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

### Good vs Bad Test Examples

**Good** (integration-style, tests observable behavior):

```typescript
test("user can checkout with valid cart", async () => {
  const cart = createCart();
  cart.add(product);
  const result = await checkout(cart, paymentMethod);
  expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
});
```

**Bad** (coupled to implementation details):

```typescript
test("checkout calls paymentService.process", async () => {
  const mockPayment = jest.mock(paymentService);
  await checkout(cart, payment);
  expect(mockPayment.process).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cart.total);
});
```

**Bad** (bypasses interface to verify):

```typescript
test("createUser saves to database", async () => {
  await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const row = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", ["Alice"]);
  expect(row).toBeDefined();
});
```

**Good** (verifies through interface):

```typescript
test("createUser makes user retrievable", async () => {
  const user = await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
  expect(retrieved.name).toBe("Alice");
});
```

### When to Mock

Mock at **system boundaries** only: External APIs, databases (prefer test DB), time/randomness, file system.

Don't mock your own classes/modules or internal collaborators. Use dependency injection at system boundaries.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This produces crap tests — tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior.

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test -> one implementation -> repeat.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED->GREEN: test1->impl1
  RED->GREEN: test2->impl2
  RED->GREEN: test3->impl3
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for deep modules (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for testability (accept dependencies don't create them, return results don't produce side effects, small surface area)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior -> test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass -> test passes
```

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test -> fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass -> passes
```

Rules: One test at a time. Only enough code to pass current test. Don't anticipate future tests.

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for refactor candidates:

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```
